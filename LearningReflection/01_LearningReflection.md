> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 

Testing the GitLab web application was highly insightful. It provided a practical understanding of key testing activities such as writing test cases for user registration, project, and issue management. The process highlighted the importance of detail and precision in testing, especially for ensuring a web application's functionality meets its design and user requirements.



## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- 

Test cases were written and managed using a structured format, starting with defining the preconditions, postconditions, and the necessary steps for executing each test. Emphasis was placed on covering both positive and negative scenarios to ensure the application's robustness. This methodical approach helped in ensuring comprehensive coverage of the application's features.



## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     
For managing test cases, tools like TestRail or Jira's Zephyr can be beneficial due to their integration capabilities with existing project management tools, providing traceability and ease of reporting. Additionally, maintaining test cases in version control systems like Git, alongside development code, can enhance collaboration and changes tracking.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
Files were edited using Visual Studio Code and CotEditor on Mac. Visual Studio Code provides extensive support for various programming languages, built-in Git integration, and a vast marketplace for extensions, making it suitable for comprehensive testing and development tasks. CotEditor, on the other hand, offers a simple and intuitive interface with features tailored for macOS users, enhancing the editing experience on the platform. Both IDEs contributed to efficient test case creation and management during the assignment.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-
Encountered minor issues with syntax errors in test scripts which were quickly resolved using the debugging tools available in Visual Studio Code. Frequent testing and validation of test scripts helped in early detection and resolution of these errors.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
 
GitHub was used to manage and store test cases and reports, facilitating easy access and version control. Previous experiences with GitHub in other projects greatly assisted in smoothly integrating it into the workflow for this assignment.
      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 
For future automation, Selenium would be an excellent choice due to its wide adoption, support for multiple browsers, and extensive community resources. Seleniumâ€™s ability to integrate with various programming languages and testing frameworks also makes it versatile for different testing needs.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 
A quick search revealed that current in-demand skills for testers include proficiency in automated testing tools like Selenium and Cypress, understanding of CI/CD pipelines, programming skills in languages like Python and Java, and familiarity with Agile and DevOps practices.


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
To advance in a software testing career, focusing on technical skills such as automated testing, CI/CD, and programming languages, along with soft skills like problem-solving, communication, and critical thinking, is essential.



## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-

his project significantly helped in applying theoretical knowledge of software testing to practical scenarios. It demonstrated the critical role of thorough testing in software development and provided firsthand experience with modern testing practices and tools.
